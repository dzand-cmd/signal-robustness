## Overview

This project performs **robustness and overfitting diagnostics** for microstructure trading signals. It is designed to stress-test short-horizon alpha signals by:

- Varying signal parameters
- Running rolling-window backtests
- Performing bootstrap confidence intervals
- Testing regime sensitivity

Designed as a portfolio project to demonstrate:

- Statistical rigor and skepticism toward results
- Quantitative research methodology
- Python data analysis and visualization
